Chromatin Single-End analysis pipeline

The SEASEQ Pipeline is a complete analysis pipeline for CHiP 
sequencing single-end data.

The analysis pipeline includes mapping using bowtie, peak-calls 
using MACS and SICER, motif analysis using meme suite,
enhancers & super-enhancers using ROSE, bam density plots 
using BAM2GFF.
